# Unexpected Routing Behavior in Next.js

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Next.js related to unexpected routing behavior when using `useRouter` and `router.push('/')` to navigate to the homepage. 

## Problem

Navigating from a page that uses `useRouter` to the homepage using `router.push('/')` might not work as expected. This can lead to issues such as the page not rendering correctly or the redirection not happening. 

## Solution

A solution is demonstrated to resolve the issue. The solution consists of different approaches to redirecting to the home page, such as using `router.replace()` or a different routing method. The implementation details are provided in the corresponding file.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the `/about` page and click the button to go to the homepage.

You will notice the difference in behavior between the original buggy approach and the corrected approach.
